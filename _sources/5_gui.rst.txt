Graphical User Interface (GUI)
===============

This page describes how to use GUI mode of ``PyFTLE3D``, which is friendly for who would like to use the software without command-line operations.
The author holds the opinion that coding should not be a barrier for using scientific analysis tools such as ``FTLE``.
For some peers or even experts and professors, coding is absolutely boring.

The GUI shares exactly the same functionalities as the command-line mode, but is more difficult to customize, as ``PyQt`` is used for building it.

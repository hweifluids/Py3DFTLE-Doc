Command-Line Mode (Commands)
============================

This page describes how to perform FTLE computation under command mode via terminal and save results to standard ``.vts`` (Visualization Toolbox Structured data) files,
which is a variation of ``.vtk`` format and supported by official ``.vtk`` API and many other post-processing platforms like ``ParaView``.
